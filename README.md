## Overview

This project demonstrates foundational computer science principles through the implementation and performance analysis of core data structures and algorithms.

The system integrates multiple concepts into a unified executable environment, enabling benchmarking and comparison of algorithm efficiency at scale.

---

## Algorithms & Structures Implemented

- Bubble Sort (step visualization + timing)
- Quickselect (kth smallest element selection)
- Hash Table (custom implementation)
- Linear Search comparison
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- Custom Set Abstract Data Type

---

## Performance Benchmarks

The project includes timing comparisons that demonstrate real-world differences in algorithm efficiency.

Example results:

- Bubble Sort vs Quickselect  
- Hash Table search vs Linear search  

These benchmarks illustrate the practical impact of time complexity (O(n²) vs O(n), O(log n), etc.).
